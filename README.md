# Anti-Trump Bias on Twitter (Microsite)

A microsite to share the results of a research project in the lab of [Dr. Tauhid Zaman](https://www.zlisto.com/). This project uses innovative data science and artificial intelligence techniques to predict the degree to which  any given Twitter account displays either a pro-Trump or anti-Trump bias. It analyzes results for Twitter accounts belonging to popular news media outlets and personalities.

## Site Map

### Homepage

The Homepage provides more information about the project and how to interpret the results.

### Game Page

The Game Page asks the visitor to guess which of two Twitter accounts has a higher predicted anti-Trump bias score.

After submitting their guess, the visitor is iteratively presented with another discrete pair of users to rank until there are no more discrete pairs remaining.

When there are no more pairs, or anytime the visitor clicks the "see full results" link, the visitor is automatically redirected to the Results Page.

### Results Page

The Results Page presents an interactive bar chart displaying the anti-Trump bias rankings of popular Twitter accounts.

Visitors can select an option from a dropdown menu to filter the users by category (e.g. "Newspaper", "TV News", etc.).

> NOTE: if possible, the visitor should be prompted to play the guessing game before viewing these results, otherwise they'll know the answers :-D
